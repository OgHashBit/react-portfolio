            "Goodnight Irene's is a popular neighborhood bar where I grew up. Their branding was dated and website non-existent. They wanted to keep their classic roots but appeal to more types of people. Plus, online presence has become even more important during COVID-19. Potential customers need a place to go for hours, updates, and menus. I worked with them to create a logo that is a fresh take on their original branding and a website that can easily be updated by their manager. It was fun to work with a new platform for me. It was also one of the most rewarding projects I've created because it was for a business that I grew up loving.",
